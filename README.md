- **Rotating User Agents**: Each request is made using a random user agent from a predefined list, simulating access from various devices and making bot activity less predictable.
- **Dynamic Device Identifiers**: The bot randomizes device identifiers for every request, making the activity look more natural and reducing detection risks.
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Implements smart rate limit handling using `Retry-After` to respect Discord's rate limits and prevent automated bans.

### 4. üîî **Logging and Notifications**

- **Detailed Logging**: Logs all bot activities‚Äîincluding Nitro snipes, giveaway entries, and errors‚Äîto a `logs.txt` file for easy tracking and troubleshooting.

## Important Functions üîë

- **`check_nitro_codes()`**: Constantly monitors messages for Nitro codes and attempts to redeem them instantly, providing real-time feedback on the status of each attempt.
- **`handle_giveaway_reaction()`**: Automatically reacts to giveaways using either interactive Discord components or emoji reactions to join as soon as possible.

## Stealth and Anti-Detection Strategies üö´

- **Rotating Custom Headers & Device IDs**: Uses unique headers and device identifiers such as `X-Fingerprint` and randomized device IDs to mimic legitimate Discord client requests.
- **User-Agent Randomization**: Each bot request uses a random user-agent string to simulate different types of devices, further hiding bot activity from detection.
- **Dynamic Device Identifiers**: Continuously changes device fingerprints to make each request appear distinct, effectively reducing the likelihood of detection by Discord's anti-bot algorithms.
- **Smart Rate Limit Compliance**: Manages rate limits intelligently by respecting Discord's `Retry-After` headers to avoid triggering anti-bot detection measures and being rate-limited.
