# Code Review and Improvement Report

## 1. Code Quality & Style

- **PEP-8 violations** detected via `flake8`. Example output:

```
./main.py:7:80: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
./main.py:25:80: E501 line too long (89 > 79 characters)
./main.py:38:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
```

- Large functions should be refactored into smaller helpers. For instance `redeem_nitro_code` handles HTTP logic and rate limiting in one place. Extract request logic to a separate module and reuse across features.
- Naming inconsistencies such as camelCase mixed with snake_case should be standardized. Stick to `snake_case` for variables and functions.

## 2. Security Review

- Ensure the `config.json` sample does not contain real tokens or webhook URLs. Use environment variables in production:

```python
config.token = os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN", config.token)
```

- No dangerous subprocess calls were found. Continue validating external inputs when redeeming Nitro codes or reading messages.
- Dependency audit using `pip-audit` could not complete due to environment limitations. Regularly run vulnerability scanners locally or in CI.

## 3. Test Coverage

Add unit tests for the main modules. Example `pytest` test for `contains_blacklisted`:

```python
from main import contains_blacklisted

def test_contains_blacklisted_case_insensitive():
    blacklist = ["BadWord"]
    assert contains_blacklisted("this has badword", blacklist)
    assert contains_blacklisted("BADWORD present", blacklist)
    assert not contains_blacklisted("nothing here", blacklist)
```

Integration tests can mock Discord API interactions using `discord.py-self` test utilities or `responses` to simulate HTTP endpoints.

## 4. CI/CD Integration

Configure GitHub Actions to run linting, security scans and tests on pull requests. Example `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
  push:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt flake8 bandit pytest
      - run: flake8
      - run: bandit -r .
      - run: pytest
```

## 5. Documentation & Examples

- Expand `README.md` with clear installation and configuration steps. Add usage examples for running the bot and interpreting log output.
- Provide a simple architecture diagram showing modules for message parsing, Nitro redemption, giveaway sniping and webhook notifications.
